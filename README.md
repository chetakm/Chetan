Smart Dustbin


IOT based smart dustbin

Aim: To Segregate the dust between dry and wet and notify the concerned authorities of the dustbin, then its give the message to blynk app.

Working: The main concept behind the IOT Based Smart Dustbin using Arduino project is Object Detection. IOT Based Smart Dustbin it is an automatic dustbin, it works like when you come in front of this dustbin it will open automatically with the help of a servo motor. So, there is some sensor work to detect the object in front of the dustbin. We have a top sensor so that it would be able to sense garbage/dust when itâ€™s within the range of 100cm, and accordingly it would be sent to Arduino so that the servo motor can rotate and the lid would be opened accordingly. Then we have another top sensor so that we would be able to increase the range from which the person can send the garbage/dustinside the automatic dustbin. Then we have 2 sensors, so when the garbage would be inserted and the lid would be closed the sensors would start to segregate the garbage into wet and dry with the help of the soil moisture sensor, which would help in determining the amount of water content that is present in the garbage inserted within the bin. The process of segregation of waste starts only after the garbage has been inserted and the lid is closed,which gets displayed on the LCD as well. Then we use a GPS Sensor so that we would be able to tell us accurately the position of the bin which is full, so that it could be replaced by the concerned authorities.
